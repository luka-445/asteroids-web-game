## Project Board


## Languages and APIs to be used
- WebGL for frontend rendering
- Javascript
- Backend (To be determined)
- Relational Database (To be determined)

## Project Structure
- docs/wireframes: 
    This folder houses the most basic design of how the individual web pages will look and that are needed. It also contains a pdf file that describes how they work and how the user can navigate between the screens.
- src/frontend:
    This folder will store all browser code. 

    For example it could contain files such as:
        - index.html
        - main.js
        - WebGL rendering code.
        - game logic.
        - Shaders
        - CSS (if any).
- src/backend:
    This folder will house the server-side code.

    It will handle:
        - Score submissions
        - storing scores
        - querying the database
        - returning leaderboard data
        - validating scores
- src/database:
    This is where database related code and items will be stored.
