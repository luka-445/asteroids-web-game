<!-- Type needs to be specified as not javascript, otherwise it will try to run the shaders as javascript code resulting in errors -->
<!-- Shaders are a c like language called GLSL and are necessary for graphic applications, the basic idea is object data i.e vectors  
     representing pixel data get sent to vertex shader (vs) as input which does some stuff through code and then the vs outputs
     it to the fragment shader (fs) which does the basically the same thing. 
     vertex shader can be viewed as doing operations on the individual pixels like changing the colour of one pixel hence the name 
     vertex shader, and then the fragment shader is a larger part where each fragment blends all of the pixels in it to get the 
     desired colour/lighting or whatever effect. They can also just do nothing, since a fs and vs are needed to actually draw pixels, 
     they must do atleast the basic operation of just specifying the location of that pixel and fragment are to be drawn on the screen. -->
